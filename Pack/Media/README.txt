TECHNICAL MECHANISIM:
- The game actually run at 10 loops per second. You will see it as 60 FPS on the observer, that's just interpolation.
- The map size is 22 x 22. The border of the map is filled with indestructible obstacles to make the boundary.
- Therefore, the actual playable map is 20 x 20, and start from 1 x 1.
- The coordinate of each object is the center point of it.
- The center point of the first playable square is x:1, y:1, on the top left of the screen.
- Tanks, bases, obstacles are squares.
- Tanks and obstacles have the size of 1 unit, while bases have the size of 2 units.
- Bullets are just points. They have no size. Collision occured when the point is inside the square of the object (or pass through the square).
- Collision checking with tank movement follow this rule:
     + Move the tank
	 + If the new position collide with another object
	 + Move the tank back to the previous position.
- Airstrike and EMP area-of-effect are circles. If the center of an object is within the circle, that object get affected.
- When checking whether a base position is within the Airstrike AOE circle, the circle radius get 1 unit bonus.
- Power up spawn randomly on 1 of 3 bridges. If all 3 bridges have existing power up, it won't spawn new one.
